# OOPs Programming Practice

Welcome to the **OOPs Programming Practice** repository! This repository is designed to help you understand and practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python.

## 📌 About
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code into objects, making it more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. This repository contains examples and exercises to help you master OOP principles.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oops-program.git
cd oops-program
```
2. **Set Up Your Environment:** (Optional)
It is recommended to create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```
3. **Run Programs:**
Navigate to the desired program and run it:
```bash
python filename.py
```

## 📖 Concepts Covered
- 🏗️ **Classes and Objects** — Blueprint and instances
- 🔗 **Inheritance** — Reusing code by deriving classes
- 🎭 **Polymorphism** — Using a single interface for different types
- 🔒 **Encapsulation** — Protecting the internal state of objects
- 🌐 **Abstraction** — Hiding complexity with simple interfaces

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
