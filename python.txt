#Python.
    Pyhton is a high level interpreted programing language.
    High level means any language which is in human readable form
    Interpreted means execution of the program happen line by line.
    programing language means a medium  of communicate or interact with system.

#features of python.
    simple and easy to learn.
    cross platfrom language and platfrom independent language.
    Extensible language.
    Dynamically typed language.
    free downloadable software.

#Variables.
    Variables are used to store data or information.
        ex: Integer
            Float
            String

#Datatypes.
   Datatypes is used to indicate or specified the type of data.
     ex: int
         Float
         bool(boolean)
         str(String)            

#operators.
    operators are symbols or Symbolic representation to perform some task.


#__str__()
  ..It is a special function which returns the strings representation of an 
    object.
  ..In python, when we print the reference Variable it implicitiy calls 
     __str__() function.
  ..To provide implementation when we print reference Variable, we should always
    override __str__() function.    




#Decorator.
 It is a function which is used to decorate add extra emplementation to 
 another function.

 In other words one function is providing additional functionality to 
 another function is called as decorates.

       syntax:@function_name.

  Rules to achieve decorater function.
   create a nested function.
   The outer function should accept one parameter which stores the address
   of function to the decorator.
   The outer function should return address of the inner function.
   Define the decorator logic inside inner function.     


       code.
                # A simple decorator function
                def decorator(func):
                
                    def wrapper():
                        print("Before calling the function.")
                        func()
                        print("After calling the function.")
                    return wrapper

                # Applying the decorator to a function
                @decorator

                def greet():
                    print("Hello, World!")

                greet()    

#Iterator.
 Iterator are functions which is used to ireverse objects or elements from a 
 collection(Group of data)

 Important methods used in iterators.
        iter()- it is used to return iterable object address.
        next()- it is used to return the object/element.



#Generator.
  Generator are functions which is used to generate a sequence of values.
            syntax: def function_name():
                        yield data.

            code.
                    # A generator function that yields 1 for first time,
                    # 2 second time and 3 third time
                    def fun():
                        yield 1            
                        yield 2            
                        yield 3            
                    
                    # Driver code to check above generator function
                    for val in fun(): 
                        print(val)
